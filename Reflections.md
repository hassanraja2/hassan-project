#Reflections

<h2> Why are we doing this? </h2>

The aim of the project was to apply all the skills and knowledge that we've learned over the four weeks into practice. I liked the project initiative which allowed us to be independent and play around with several tools and technologies to get a working solution. 

<h2> How I expected the challenge to go. </h2>

The challenge was quite tricky as it involved working with several tools and technologies which meant that if one of them wasn't working then the whole application wouldn't work. 


<h2> What went well? </h2>

I managed to succesfully deploy and test the application and I became confident with using Jenkins, Nexus, Docker and various other tools. In adddition to this, I also used Sonarqube to test the quality of the code which was really interesting to see. 


<h2> What didn't go as planned? </h2>


I was having some issues with unit testing but then after consulting with Ben, I managed to fix the problem. 


<h2> Possible improvements for future challenges. </h2>

For future challenges, I would like to deploy and test more difficult applications so that I can become even better at using Docker-compose and other tools.
