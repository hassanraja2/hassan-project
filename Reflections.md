#Reflections

<h2> Why are we doing this? </h2>

The aim of the project was to apply all the skills and knowledge that we've learned over the four weeks into practice. I liked the project initiative which allowed us to be independent and play around with several tools and technologies to get a working solution. 

<h2> How I expected the challenge to go. </h2>
What went well?
What didn't go as planned?
Possible improvements for future challenges.
