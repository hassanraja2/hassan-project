<h2> Why are we doing this? </h2>

The aim of the project was to apply all the skills and knowledge that we've learned over the four weeks into practice. I liked the project initiative which allowed us to be independent and play around with several tools and technologies to get a working solution. 

<h2> How I expected the challenge to go. </h2>

The challenge was quite tricky as it involved working with several tools and technologies which meant that if one of them wasn't working then the whole application wouldn't work. 


<h2> What went well? </h2>

In terms of deploying the application, I used Jenkins automatation tool, which allowed me to effectively deploy the app onto the relevant ports. Furthermore, I used docker-compose for running the containers and the images have been pushed to the Nexus repository. Please see the BuildSucess file inside Overallmetric folder. Once the application was build, I then conducted unit testing which showed test coverage for each service (Please see the testcoverage file inside Overallmetric folder.) Furthermore, I used Sonarqube to test the quality of the code and to find any security issues with the code and the results have been uploaded as screenshots inside Overall metric folder. It is cruicial to test the application for any flaws because as the developer and DevOps engineer you need to make sure that the work meets the organsiation standard. if the application doesn't get tested, then this can bring an opportnity for hackers to break into the system/ 


<h2> What didn't go as planned? </h2>


I was having some issues with unit testing but then after consulting with Ben, I managed to fix the problem. 


<h2> Possible improvements for future challenges. </h2>
If i did this task again, I would read the breif more carefully as I misundertood the part of inluding ansible playbook which meant I could have saved a lot of time.
